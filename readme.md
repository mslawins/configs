## Configs

This repository contains configs I personally use. Everything is set up to work cross platform with Dropbox
with as little installation as possible.

### Vim requirements

- Vim >=8.0 or MacVim >=8.0 with python3 enabled

### Usage with Dropbox

Put this in .vimrc:

- set runtimepath+=~/Dropbox/configs/vim
- source ~/Dropbox/configs/vim/vimrc.vim

### Example
